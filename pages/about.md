For the last 14 years, Rucheli has used the guidance found in Jewish mysticism along with the tools and strategies found in Positive Psychology to build her own success, like catapulting her career from $65K to a multiple six-figure salary in just 6.5 years, building a career coaching business in under 5 hours a week, and creating a life where truly anything is possible.

Rucheli brings humor and insights from her personal journey of creating a meaningful life in the fast-paced world of technology and entrepreneurship into everything she does, whether it's writing, speaking, podcasting, leading interactive workshops online, or crafting transformative in-person experiences.

Rucheli is a member of the International Positive Psychology Association (IPPA), a Certified Applied Positive Psychology Practitioner, a Flourishing Skills GroupÂ® facilitator, and is constantly leveling up her expertise to better serve the individuals and companies she works with on a regular basis.

When she's not helping people live life on purpose, she's probably on an adventure outdoors, traveling the world, or (as an autodidact and polymath) picking up whatever hobby strikes her fancy that week.
